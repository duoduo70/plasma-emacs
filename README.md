# plasma-emacs
A public domain emacs config.

For now, this project is in Chinese. But you can trans it and create a PR , modify this repo and publish your version, and so on, because it is a public domain project.

If you want to know what can you do, press *Alt + x* in Plasma Emacs and input **document** .

It is a modular project. For now I just supported *core*.
But for tomorrow, I will to supported *languages* config frame.

Lots of people say to me: "Hey, do not use VSCode, Space Emacs is good for me!". But I do not like it. Emacs is free. They are fishlike.

**Enjoy!**
