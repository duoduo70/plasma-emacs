# plasma-emacs
A public domain emacs config.

For now, this project is in Chinese. But you can trans it and create a PR , modify this repo and publish your version, and so on, because it is a public domain project.

If you want to know what can you do, press *Alt + x* in Plasma Emacs and input **document** .

It is a modular project. For now I just supported *core*.
But for tomorrow, I will to supported *languages* config frame.

This repo is kind of big. Because it has too many git submodules. Updating it is like *pacman* . This repo's packages are lastest at all time.

Lots of people say to me: "Hey, do not use VSCode, Space Emacs is good for me!". But I do not like it. Emacs is free. They are fishlike.

### Warning:
For now, you have to update your Emacs to Emacs 29 (I just test the configs on Emacs 30). I may support elder versions in the future.
But you can update your Emacs to Emacs 29. It is good for you. Because you can install new packages and update old packages in the future.

**Enjoy!**
