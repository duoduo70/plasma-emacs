      If there is an error please reproduce the issue with `toggle-debug-on-error` and after setting `lsp-print-io` to t, and then include the callstack and attach the content of `*lsp-log*` buffer and the content of the server log(use `lsp-workspace-show-log`)

      If `emacs` hangs please do `M-x` `toggle-debug-on-quit` and then do `C-g` when emacs hangs and include the callstack as part of the issue report.

      ``` emacs-lisp
      (setq lsp-print-io t)
