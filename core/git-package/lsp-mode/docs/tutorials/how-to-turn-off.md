# A guide on disabling/enabling lsp-mode features

Early in the project, we decided to auto-configure/enable all of the stable
features by default in order to improve discoverability and simplify the setup
for the beginners. This decision was considered good by the majority of the
users coming from IDEs but still in `Emacs` community there are a lot of people
looking for a minimal distraction-free experience especially traditional long
time users. Although the turn off `defcustom` settings are documented in
corresponding `README` and available via `customize-group` it turned out that it
is not very easy to findÂ them when you want to turn a particular feature off
which led to a lot of frustration. Hopefully, this article will help solving
that issue:
