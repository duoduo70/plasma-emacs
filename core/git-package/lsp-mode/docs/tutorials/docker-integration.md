# Docker integration

Author: [@factyy](https://github.com/factyy)

## Reason
You can use docker-wrapped both the language server and debugger and connect to them using LSP/DAP.
Imagine that you have a short-time project (or a sideproject) and you don't want to bring any software packages to your local machine.
Now it is simple: wrap the language server and debugger you need in `docker` and use `lsp-docker` for LSP and `dap-mode` for DAP.

## Features
Most of the `lsp-mode` and `dap-mode` features, but with the ability to use containerized environments.  
  
*Note: some of the features may yet to be tested, so any help finding and fixing any bugs in them is highly appreciated!*

## Components: Language Server / LSP support
You can use manually built containers or images hosting language server(s), just follow a few simple rules (shown below).  
  
*Note: this info is based on the readme in the original project, take a look at [lsp-docker](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker) for additional info.*

### Building a container (or an image):
You have 2 constraints:

A language server must be launched in stdio mode (other types of communication are yet to be supported).
A docker container (only container subtype, see the configuration below) must have your language server as an entrypoint (basically you have to be able to launch it with `docker start -i <container_name>` as it is launched this way with `lsp-docker`).
When you have sucessfully built a language server, you have to register it with either a configuration file or a .dir-locals file.

### Registering a language server using a persistent configuration file:
A configuration file is a yaml file that is named `.lsp-docker.yml` or `.lsp-docker.yaml` and looks generally like this:
``` yaml
lsp:
  server:
    type: docker
    subtype: container # Or image. container subtype means launching an existing container
    # image subtype means creating a new container each time from a specified image
    name: not-significant-but-unique-name # Must be unique across all language servers
    server: server-id-of-the-base-server # Server id of a registered server (by lsp-mode) 
    launch_command: "launch command with arguments" # Launch command of the language server
    # (selected by a server id specified above) in stdio mode
    # Note: launch_command is not used with container subtype servers
    # as a command is embedded in a container itself and serves as an entrypoint
  mappings:
    - source: "/your/host/source/path"
      destination: "/your/local/path/inside/a/container"
```

### Registering a language server using a .dir-locals file:
Just refer to the source code and general conventions of using .dir-locals. The variable you need is lsp-docker-persistent-default-config, its content is merged with the lsp section from a configuration file (if present).

## Components: Debugger / DAP
  
*Note: this info is based on the readme in the original project, take a look at [dap-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode) for additional info.*

Configure it either with a `.dir-locals` file or drop an `.lsp-docker.yml` configuration file (use `lsp-docker` for general reference). Basically you have one function `dap-docker-register` that performs all the heavy lifting (finding the original debug template, patching it, registering a debug provider e.t.c). This function examines a configuration file or falls back to the default configuration (which can be patched using the `.dir-locals` approach, take a note that the default configuration doesnâ€™t provide any sane defaults for debugging) and then operates on the combination of the two. This mechanism is the same as in `lsp-docker`.  

*Note: currently you cannot use this mode when using a network connection to connect to debuggers (this part is yet to be implemented). Still want to talk to debuggers over network? In order to do so you have to look at the launch-args patching done by `dap-docker--dockerize-start-file-args`, you have to somehow assign `nil` to `dap-server-path` before it is passed further into session creation.*

If you want to stick to a configuration file, take a look at the example below:
``` yaml
lsp:
  server:
    # 'lsp-docker' fields
  mappings:
    - source: "/your/host/source/path" # used both by 'lsp-docker' and 'dap-docker'
      destination: "/your/local/path/inside/a/container" # used both by 'lsp-docker' and 'dap-docker'
  debug:
    type: docker # only docker is supported
    subtype: image # or 'container'
    name: <docker image or container that has the debugger in> # you can omit this field
    # in this case the 'lsp-docker' ('server' section) image name is used
    enabled: true # you can explicitly disable 'dap-docker' by using 'false'
    provider: <your default language debug provider, double quoted string>
    template: <your default language debug template, double quoted string>
    launch_command: <an explicit command if you want to override a default one provided by the debug provider>
    # e.g. if you have installed a debug server in a different directory, not used with 'container' subtype debuggers
```
## Examples
Let's develop and debug a simple Ruby application (that uses bundler nonetheless).  
In the project folder we have at least the actual code and `Gemfile` with `Gemfile.lock`.

First of all we have to build the images and containers. Let's stick with an image for a language server and a container for debugging. In order to have LSP support in Ruby we have to place `solargraph` in `Gemfile`.

### Building: Language Server 
So it is easy to use something like this as a `Dockerfile` for a language server (using `debian-slim` as a base image, but it is a matter of personal taste):
``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.1.1-slim-bullseye as app

# What if your gems use native extensions?
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# You may decide not to create a user, it is ok to delete these lines
RUN addgroup --gid 1000 user && \
    adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' --uid 1000 --gid 1000 user

# Just an appropriate folder, a matter of taste again
RUN mkdir /app && chown user:user /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install all the gems, INCLUDING the language server
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install

# Use the created user, remove this line if you deleted the user creation lines
USER user
```
You may build it with something like this `docker build -t lsp-docker-ruby-server .` while you are in the project folder.  

### Building: Debugger

With a debugger it is a bit more complicated: first of all you need `node` to run the DAP server (as it is a VSCode extension) and second you need to place the extension into the container. You can download the extension (take the latest version) from the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) and place it in your project folder (`vspackage.zip` for convenience).  
In this case your `Dockerfile` may look like this:
``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.1.1-slim-bullseye as app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    nodejs \
    unzip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a folder for the debugger
RUN mkdir /debugger
WORKDIR /debugger
COPY vspackage.zip .
RUN unzip vspackage.zip -d .

RUN addgroup --gid 1000 user && \
    adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' --uid 1000 --gid 1000 user

RUN mkdir /app && chown user:user /app
WORKDIR /app

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install

USER user
```
Again you may build it with something like this `docker build -t dap-docker-ruby-server .` while you are in the project folder. But as we decided to stick with a container for the debugger, we need to create one! It is easy (but take note that we **have to specify the folder mappings when creating a container!**): ``docker create -i -v `pwd`:/app -w /app --name dap-docker-ruby-server dap-docker-ruby-server node /debugger/extension/dist/debugger/main.js``.  
  
### Configuration
Lets use a `yaml` persistent configuration, we may use something like this (in `.lsp-docker.yml` in the project folder):
``` yaml
lsp:
  server:
    type: docker
    subtype: image
    name: lsp-docker-ruby-server
    server: ruby-ls
    launch_command: "bundle exec solargraph stdio"
  mappings:
    - source: "."
      destination: "/app"
  debug:
    type: docker
    subtype: container
    name: dap-docker-ruby-server
    enabled: true
    provider: "Ruby"
    template: "Ruby::Run"
    launch_command: "node /debugger/extension/dist/debugger/main.js" # It is meaningless as we use a container, but still
```
Next we have to register both language server and debugger when the project is opened in Emacs: use `lsp-docker-register` and `dap-docker-register` interactive functions.  
If everything is fine you may launch a language server by a simple `lsp` invocation and DAP by `dap-debug` and selecting a dockerized debug template.
